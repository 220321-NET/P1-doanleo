When within the store, they are sent to the default "The Apple Store" and are given two options

-View Customer's Order History across all stores
-Change Store they're at, this function is used in various menus

Upon viewing a store's inventory, they can add one of the items to their cart, remove items from the cart, check out, or change to another store
If the user is an employee, they are allowed to restock the store they're at

Upon viewing their order history, it will give the option to sort their orders, upon selecting the same sort again, it will change between ascending and descending order
If the user is an employee, they are redirected to looking at the store's orders and can change the store they're looking at. There is also an option to swap between viewing their own orders or the stores.
